# Bot Generator

## Description

This utility runs a chat bot in RPA Studio to generate:
 - Wal 
 - Yaml 
 
This utility can also take BPMN generated by IBM BlueWorks Live.

## Usage

Download this repo as a zip and extract to a folder of your choice.

- In RPA Studio, open BotApiGenerator/bot/BuildABot.wal
- Run this script WITHOUT DEBUg (ctl + F5).  If you run with debug the generated script will be malformed
- When the chat bot appears, sele N to generate the bot from the chat bot, and then select the chat bot carousel buttons to add your bot name and parameters.
- When done select generate.  Avoid using the mouse or keyboard until the bot has finished generation.
- Once finished, you should see the generated wal in Studio, and a browser window containing the YAML which you can use to invoke the bot.
- Manually deploy the bot to your tenant and then use the API editor to test your Bot.

## Bugs and Limitations

If your BPMN contains subprocesses, the subprocess is generated as a separate txt file.  
This file needs to be created as a WAL and  referred to in the ExecuteScript statement of the calling WAL script.

Duplicate functions are created when generating subprocesses
